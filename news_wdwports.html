    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 250%;">Who Dares Wins Ports Now Available!</h1>
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    You heard right! Now that we're officially revisiting eras, one thing I wanted to experiment with was the viability of porting older missions to the new modpack. Partly for a bit of fun, but also to see how our missions have improved over time.
    With this, 5 of your favourite Who Dares Wins missions are now available to play on the server!
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">So What's Changed?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Truthfully, the answer is nothing. All of these missions have had their old files from Winter 2021 loaded straight into the modern modpack, and with a few invisible items removed and sounds replaced, they are playable within the LOTU modpack.
      I can't guarantee that they'll fully work, or that errors won't occur but the missions are there and they should be playable at the least, start to finish.
      <br><br>The only difference is that I've added open arsenals in the spawn area of all the missions, this is because we played WDW in a time before we used ACE so you have no medical supplies in the default loadouts. It's up to you how to proceed, you can just add medical stuff and play them with their intended loadouts or use the open arsenal to put a spin on things, its up to you! 
    </p>
        
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">List of Available Missions:</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Operation Sanctuary [Chernarus Winter]
        <br>Operation Overlord: SAS [Omaha]
        <br>Operation Overlord: US Army [Omaha]
        <br>Operation Wetwork [Henderson Airfield]
        <br>Operation Gunnerside [NF Talvivaara]
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why are some missions omitted?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Both parts of Gaff and Squatter had to be left out of this remaster because they used specific maps that were not part of the World War 2 core content. Lythium and the Dunkirk map are not part of the updated modpack so porting them over was impossible. A remaster could still be on the table for these missions at some point so keep an eye out.
      <br><br>The keen eyed amongst you may also notice one mission that I've not mentioned yet from WDW, well keep a look out inside the LOTU missions. It may *ambush* you with a hidden remaster at some point...
